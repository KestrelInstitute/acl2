# This file currently defines a manually-triggered workflow that you can invoke from GitHub Actions.
# Currently it only has one job, which runs on ubuntu, uses ccl, builds acl2 and
# builds the regression books using two cores (the maximum for a GitHub-hosted runner).

name: regression

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch,
  # but for now this is commented out because we want manual trigger.
  #push:
  #  branches: [ master ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo 'Hello world, pwd=' `pwd` ' $GITHUB_WORKSPACE=' "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"

      # Note, if we wanted to actually build ccl here, we would not need to do
      # everything that we do with a Docker build,
      # because the ubuntu github runner comes already updated and provisioned
      # with wget, git, build-essential, and m4.

      # However, for just loading ccl, we can use the prebuilt tarball
      # without the extra git info.

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
